our mobile forceplate is controlled via in-house-software on the raspberry pi

## what is running
 - v0.2 (09.02.2020)
   - jumping is implemented (keystroke)
   - collision detection
   - works now with all kind of monitor_framerates

 - v0.1 (03.01.2020)
   - welcome screen
   - countdown
   - landscape is automatically *side_scrolling* till end

## todo
 - implement forceplate
   - connect
   - calibrate
   - fetch data
   - calculate data/jump
 - finetuning *physics*: define how hero is acting, depending on input data from forceplate
 - intro_screens
   - e.g. multiplayer, aks for name,...
